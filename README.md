## Introduction

Hailing from the Ten Towns region, Tashia is a young female elven sorceress. After some dark moments in her past, Tashia is currently taking a break from adventuring. Once you convince her to join, you will find her a loyal, steadfast traveling companion.

Tashia is romanceable, and the mod spans both Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal. She has dialogue with every NPC, plenty of non-party interactions, and three different epilogues.

*Please check the complete [Readme](https://spellhold-studios.github.io/readmes/tashia-npc/readme.htm) to learn more about this mod before installation.*

### Biography

> When asked about her past, a sad expression darkens Tashia's pale face for a moment. She tells you that she was born somewhere in the vicinity of Ten-Towns in the north, uncertain what her parents were doing so far away from other elven settlements. Her childhood home was destroyed along with the entire city of Targos when a powerful spellcaster terrorized Icewind Dale back when she was just a child. With both her parents dead, she was only able to stay alive at the time due to kindness of strangers, many of whom lost their loved ones as well. She mentions growing up in a foster home with five other children who ended up adventuring together exploring lands south of Ten-Towns, and eventually south of Spine of the World as well. It was in the city of Neverwinter where she met Arilistan, a young human Kensai whom she fell in love with. She mentions the events surrounding the next few years with tragic sadness in her voice, talking about how they adventured together farther along the Sword Coast, then suddenly stops, explaining that she already said too much. You notice tears forming in her deep jade eyes just before she turns away and resumes her journey.

**Special Thanks and Acknowledgments from Bri**

- First, I would like to thank Arian for making Tashia in the first place. She was the first fan-made mod I played for any game. Of course, Arian needs to be thanked for allowing Tashia to be an 'open-mod' and subject to further change to all.
- Second, I owe a debt of gratitude to Lord Ernie. Without his coding (as well as editing/sounding board/etc.) this version of Tashia would never have been finished.
- BigRob and KIrving are owed a heap of appreciation as well. They also were a big help especially with editing and general input.
- This word of thanks goes out to Grim Squeaker for his aid on the Bodhi Abduction, as well as finding the updated Tashia portrait, and other assistance.
- A special thanks to Amalthea who created the first Tashia portrait, and then the newest one included with our version of the mod.
- Additionally, Rathwallin's suggestions were a big help on Tashia's special item.
- Also, thanks to Darios for lending the inventory bam for that same special item.
- Of course, we wouldn't be anywhere without SConrad and the other Spellhold Studio staff for hosting Tashia, as well as other forum-related help.
- A personal thanks to CamDawg, whose initial commentary motivated me to continue when my interest flagged.
- And finally, a thank you to JCompton as well, who had expressed surprise that there were those who wanted some kind of Tashia update, which served as motivation for me to at least try my hand at writing new material.
